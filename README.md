# Kickstarter_analysis
Module 1 Challenge


### Challenge

Presents a cohesive written analysis that draws three reasonable conclusions from the data and states limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables or graphs.

Conclusions:
•	The volume of Plays with goals larger than 25,000 is small, so it is difficult to tell if the percentage is a reliable indicator. The percentages also vary significantly with large swings

•	Aside from the above the data shows that plays with goals under $5000 have a reasonable chance of success at just under 75%

•	The outcome based on launch date chart shows a spike in successes for May launched. Its unclear why this is true, but the data indicates that this should be looked into further

•	A general observation is that Theatric kickstarter volume peaked in 2015 

•	Data related to tourism may be valuable to compare increase in population to launch dates

•	Spotlight & staff pick are worthwhile data point to investigate. Whether or not a theatric event has this status may be significant to its success. Potential investors and attendees would gain added confidence in the event if its spotlighted or recommended
